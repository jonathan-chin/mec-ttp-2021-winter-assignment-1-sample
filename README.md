## [start]
You wake up in an unfamiliar dystopian future. There is a cybernetic cat on the dresser, half of a lightsaber, and an old typewriter in the corner. What do you do?

**[pet the cat]**

**[examine the half laser-sword]**

**[try to type something]**

---

## [pet the cat]
You pet the cat, and he immediately lets you know where the can opener and his food is. He says, "Finally you're awake to feed me. Let's go!". And then he leaves the room, clearly expecting you to follow. You:

**[follow him]**

**[lock the door behind him]**

---

## [examine the half laser-sword]
It looks like this sword was used heavily in combat, do you:

**[Add the laser-sword to your inventory]**

**[Leave the laser-sword where you found it]**


---

## [follow him]

When you arrive in the kitchen and reach for the can opener, it dawns on you: did the cat really just talk? You turn to him and suddenly find that he's transformed into a full fledged human being.

**[fight him]**

**[run away]**
